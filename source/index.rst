Demystifying TYPO3
==================

This project will not provide a full blown tutorial. Target audience are users who already know how
to setup and work with TYPO3, but do not know the "why" and "how" does something work.

You will learn how bits and peaces fit together and get an overview about the whole system.
Afterwards you should know how and why something works and how you can extend parts of TYPO3.

For best experience, follow the numbered order as each section might expect knowledge from sections
before.

The goal
--------

The goal is to describe how specific parts are working, and what you can do with the understanding.

Current state
-------------

This project is currently in early alpha. Parts are added time by time. Please provide feedback at
the project home: https://github.com/DanielSiepmann/Demystifying-TYPO3

Please provide feedback which topics need to be covered, which parts are to short or long. I'll try
to continually improve this document.

Once this project useful for a wide audience and I know where it fits, I'll migrate it to
docs.typo3.org.
