Demystifying TYPO3
==================

This project will not provide a full blown tutorial. Target audience are users who already know how
to setup and work with TYPO3, but do not know the "why" and "how" does something work.

You will learn how bits and peaces fit together and get an overview about the whole system.
Afterwards you should know how and why something works and how you can extend parts of TYPO3.

For best experience, follow the numbered order as each section might expect knowledge from sections
before.
