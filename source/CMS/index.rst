CMS

TYPO3 is a CMS (=Content management system), which in turn tells us it's intended to manage content.
And TYPO3 is good in doing so. The backend provides a flexible configuration interface to build
forms to manage content. TYPO3 has a page tree which makes it easy for many people to get the
structure, as it's known from *Explorer* of Microsoft Windows.

And TYPO3 is extendible. We can define custom content elements and pages within TYPO3, just using
Configuration. Most of the time TYPO3 already provides the necessary implementation to deliver the
content. There is often no need to create an extension with logic, only with configuration.

In the following sections, you will learn to understand TYPO3 as a CMS, how to extend the existing
content parts and to prevent the need for further extensions delivering logic.

In the end you are able to write extensions with configuration and templates only.
